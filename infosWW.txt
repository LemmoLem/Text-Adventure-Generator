Shocked Bandana@I don't know what they're supposed to do, but I don't like them.
Cynical Spur@I don't think they're worth the money.
Mesmerized Boot@Boots are the best thing in the world.
Arrogant Poncho@I don't think they're very practical.
Jealous Jean@Jeans are the worst. They're tight and they're not comfortable.
Positive Overall@I really like overalls! They're comfortable and they look good on anyone.
Negative Flannel Shirt@I don't like flannel shirts. They're uncomfortable and itchy.
Hateful Glove@Gloves are the epitome of unnecessary, over-the-top coddling. They're like the little kid who insists on wearing a helmet when they go out riding their bike - it's not necessary and it just makes them look foolish.
